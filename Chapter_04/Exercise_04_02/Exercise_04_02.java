/**
 * *4.2 (Geometry: great circle distance) The great circle distance is the
 * distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. Let (x1, y1) and (x2,
 * y2) be the geographical latitude and longitude of two points. The great
 * circle distance between the two points can be computed using the following
 * formula: d = radius * arccos(sin (x1) * sin(x2) + cos(x1) * cos(x2) * cos(y1
 * - y2)) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the latitude and
 * longitude of two points on the earth in degrees and displays its great circle
 * distance. The average radius of the earth is 6,371.01 km. Note you need to
 * convert the degrees into radians using the Math.toRadians method since the
 * Java trigonometric methods use radians. The latitude and longitude degrees in
 * the formula are for north and west. Use negative to indicate south and east
 * degrees. Here is a sample run:
 *
 * Enter point 1 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 39.55 âˆ’116.25 Enter point
 * 2 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 41.5 87.37 The distance between the
 * two points is 10691.79183231593 km
