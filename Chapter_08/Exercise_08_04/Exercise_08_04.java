 *
 *  (Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all 
 * employees are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employeeâ€™s 
 * seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, the following array 
 * stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a program that displays 
 * employees and their total hours in decreasing order of the total hours.
