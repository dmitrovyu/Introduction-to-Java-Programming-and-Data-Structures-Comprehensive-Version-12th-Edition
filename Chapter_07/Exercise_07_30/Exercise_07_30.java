 *
 * (Pattern recognition: consecutive four equal numbers) Write the following 
 * method that tests whether the array has four consecutive numbers with the same value:
 *      public static boolean isConsecutiveFour(int[] values)
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers
 * and displays it if the series contains four consecutive numbers with the same value.
 * Your program should first prompt the user to enter the input sizeâ€”i.e., 
 * the number of values in the series. 
 * 
 * Here are sample runs:
 * 
 * Enter the number of values: 8 
 * Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 5 5 4 5 
 * The list has consecutive fours
 * Enter the number of values: 9 
 * Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 6 5 5 4 5 
 * The list has no consecutive fours
