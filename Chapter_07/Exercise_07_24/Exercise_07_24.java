 *
 * * **7.24 (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
 * problem with many practical applications. The problem is to repeatedly pick
 * objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
 * a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly, and find out how many picks are needed
 * before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
 * before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
 * to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
 * card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:
 *
 *      Queen of Spades
 *      5 of Clubs
 *      Queen of Hearts
 *      4 of Diamonds
 *      Number of picks: 12
