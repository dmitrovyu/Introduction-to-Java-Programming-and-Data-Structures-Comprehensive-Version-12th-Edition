 *
 * (Geometry: the bounding rectangle) A bounding rectangle is the minimum
 * rectangle that encloses a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, as shown in
 * Figure 10.24d. Write a method that returns a bounding rectangle for a set of
 * points in a two-dimensional plane, as follows:
 * public static MyRectangle2D getRectangle(double[][] points)
 * The Rectangle2D class is defined in Programming Exercise 10.13. Write a test
 * program that prompts the user to enter five points and displays the bounding
 * rectangleâ€™s center, width, and height. Here is a sample run:
 *
 *          Enter five points: 1.0 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 *          The bounding rectangle's center (5.0, 6.25), width 8.0, height 7.5
