/**
 * (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers) 
 * Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how 
 * many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average
 * of the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. 
 * Display the average as a floating-point number. 
 * Here are sample runs:
 *  Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 â€“1 3 0 
 *  The number of positives is 3
 *  The number of negatives is 1
 *  The total is 5.0
 *  The average is 1.25
 * 
 *  Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 0 
 *  No numbers are entered except 0
